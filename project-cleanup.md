- [x] Verified flame icons (üî•) working on live site
- [x] Cleaned up debug/migration endpoints for security

### File Structure Improvements  
- [x] Created `static/img/webp/` for optimized images
- [x] Created `static/img/responsive/` for responsive variants
- [x] Created `static/css/critical/` for critical CSS

### Documentation Added
- [x] Created image optimization guide
- [x] Created this cleanup checklist

## üîÑ Recommended Next Steps

### Performance Optimizations (Image-Focused)

#### Large Images That Need Compression
**Hero Slides (Priority: HIGH)**
- [ ] `static/img/slide/hero_slide1.png` (2.1MB) ‚Üí Target: <300KB
- [ ] `static/img/slide/hero_slide2.png` (2.0MB) ‚Üí Target: <300KB  
- [ ] `static/img/slide/hero_slide3.png` (2.0MB) ‚Üí Target: <300KB

**Logo Files (Priority: MEDIUM)**
- [ ] `static/img/logos/site/prop_tools_logo.png` (1.3MB) ‚Üí Target: <200KB
- [ ] `static/img/logos/site/pt_favicon.png` (529KB) ‚Üí Target: <50KB

#### Optimization Strategy
1. **WebP Conversion** - Convert large PNG files to WebP format with fallback:
   ```html
   <picture>
     <source srcset="hero_slide1.webp" type="image/webp">
     <img src="hero_slide1.png" alt="Hero slide">
   </picture>
   ```

2. **Responsive Images** - Create multiple sizes for different screen widths:
   - Mobile: 480px width
   - Tablet: 768px width  
   - Desktop: 1200px width
   - Large: 1920px width

3. **Tools for Optimization**:
   - **Online**: TinyPNG, Squoosh.app
   - **CLI**: `cwebp`, `imagemagick`
   - **Node**: `sharp`, `imagemin`

4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - [ ] Place optimized WebP files in `static/img/webp/`
   - [ ] Place responsive variants in `static/img/responsive/`
   - [ ] Update templates to use `<picture>` elements
   - [ ] Add lazy loading: `loading="lazy"`
   - [ ] Update hero component JS to load appropriate sizes

**Expected Benefits**:
- **Load Time**: 60-80% reduction in image load time
- **Bandwidth**: Significant savings for mobile users
- **SEO**: Improved Core Web Vitals scores
- **UX**: Faster page loads, better perceived performance

### Code Quality
- [ ] Add type hints to Python functions (gradual implementation)  
- [ ] Consider adding pre-commit hooks for code quality
- [ ] Add docstrings to complex functions in analytics.py

### Security Enhancements
- [ ] Verify CSP headers are working correctly in production
- [ ] Test security.txt file accessibility 
- [ ] Review analytics data retention policies

### Monitoring & Maintenance
- [ ] Set up automated dependency updates (Dependabot/Renovate)
- [ ] Monitor Core Web Vitals scores
- [ ] Create database backup strategy for analytics data

## üìä Project Health Status

### File Organization: ‚úÖ EXCELLENT
- Clean separation of concerns
- Proper template inheritance 
- Well-structured SCSS architecture
- Logical blueprints organization

### Dependencies: ‚úÖ CLEAN
- No unused Python packages remaining
- Minimal, focused dependency list
- Proper version pinning

### Security: ‚úÖ GOOD
- CSP headers implemented
- Security.txt present
- HTTPS redirects in place
- Session security configured

### Performance: ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS ATTENTION  
- Large image files (main bottleneck)
- No image optimization strategy
- Missing lazy loading

## üéØ Priority Actions

1. **HIGH**: Optimize hero slide images (biggest performance impact)
2. **MEDIUM**: Implement responsive images 
3. **LOW**: Add type hints and better documentation

## Notes
- Project structure is already well-organized
- Focus should be on performance optimizations
- Consider image optimization as the highest priority
- All critical security measures are in place
