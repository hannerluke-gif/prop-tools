Q: What is a futures contract?
A: A futures contract obligates buyer and seller to transact an asset at a set price on a future date. Most retail traders close the position before expiration.

Q: How does margin work in futures?
A: Futures use performance bonds (margin) instead of paying full value. This creates leverageâ€”small price moves can create large gains or losses.
